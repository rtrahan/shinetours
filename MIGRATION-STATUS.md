# ShineTours Migration Status: .NET → Next.js + Supabase

## Summary

I've started the migration but need to be transparent: **This is a 20-30 hour rewrite** to recreate all the functionality you currently have working in the .NET app.

## What's Complete

### ✅ Foundation (Done)

1. **Next.js 15 Project**
   - App Router configured
   - TypeScript setup
   - Tailwind CSS working
   - Font configuration (Cormorant Garamond + Inter)

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Client and server utilities created
   - Database schema file ready (`supabase-schema.sql`)
   - All tables defined: guides, tour_groups, booking_requests, tour_settings
   - Row Level Security policies configured
   - Proper indexes for performance

3. **Authentication**
   - Middleware protecting admin/guide routes
   - Supabase Auth ready to integrate
   - Type definitions for all models

4. **Deployment Ready**
   - `vercel.json` configured
   - Environment variable setup
   - Build configuration ready

## What Needs Building (Est. 20-30 hours)

### 📄 Pages (8-10 hours)

- [ ] **Home Page with Calendar** - Interactive booking calendar, form validation, "others joining" modal
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard** - Unified table, filters, sorting, modals for details/Yale/confirm  
- [ ] **Guide Dashboard** - Same table, claim functionality, workflow buttons
- [ ] **Login Page** - Supabase Auth integration

### 🔌 API Routes (6-8 hours)

- [ ] `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking requests
- [ ] `GET /api/bookings/month` - Calendar data
- [ ] `GET /api/bookings/date` - Details for specific date
- [ ] `GET /api/tours` - List all tour groups
- [ ] `POST /api/tours` - Create tour group
- [ ] `PATCH /api/tours/[id]/assign-guide` - Assign guide
- [ ] `PATCH /api/tours/[id]/submit-yale` - Mark as submitted to Yale
- [ ] `PATCH /api/tours/[id]/confirm` - Enter Yale confirmation
- [ ] `PATCH /api/tours/[id]/complete` - Mark complete
- [ ] `POST /api/tours/[id]/claim` - Guide claims tour
- [ ] `POST /api/tours/[id]/unclaim` - Guide releases tour

### 🧩 Components (6-8 hours)

- [ ] Calendar component with availability logic
- [ ] Sortable table component
- [ ] Filter pills component  
- [ ] Details modal component
- [ ] Yale submission modal
- [ ] Confirmation modal
- [ ] Button components with icons

### 🔐 Auth & Security (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Login/logout functionality
- [ ] Role-based access (Admin vs Guide)
- [ ] Password hashing (Supabase handles this)
- [ ] Protected API routes

### 📧 Email (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Supabase Edge Function for sending emails
- [ ] Resend.com or SendGrid integration
- [ ] Email templates

## Current .NET App

Your **production-ready** .NET app is at:
```
/Users/roberttrahan/Developer/ShineTours
```

It has ALL features working:
- ✅ Complete booking workflow
- ✅ Admin dashboard with Yale submission
- ✅ Guide dashboard with claiming
- ✅ Sortable tables, filters, modals
- ✅ Preferred guide selection
- ✅ Beautiful UI

## Decision Point

**Option A: Deploy .NET Now (Recommended)**
```bash
# 30 minutes to production
cd /Users/roberttrahan/Developer/ShineTours/ShineTours
# Deploy to Railway
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway up
```
Cost: $5/month, App live today

**Option B: Continue Next.js Migration**
- Time investment: 20-30 more hours
- Cost: $0 (free tiers)
- Result: Same functionality, different stack

## Next Steps If Continuing Migration

1. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create project at supabase.com
   - Run `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL Editor
   - Copy API keys to `.env.local`

2. **Build the pages** (I can help with this)
   - Start with home page calendar
   - Then admin dashboard
   - Then guide dashboard

3. **Create API routes** (I can help)

4. **Test everything**

5. **Deploy to Vercel** (1 command)

## My Recommendation

Your .NET app is **excellent** and production-ready. Railway deployment takes 30 minutes vs. 20-30 hours of rewriting.

But if you want to learn Next.js/Supabase or prefer the Vercel ecosystem, the foundation is solid and I can continue building!
